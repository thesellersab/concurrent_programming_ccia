## Project 1: “Hello Concurrency World”

### Main Concepts:
- Basic thread creation and joining
- Simple concurrency primitives

### Project Idea: Prime Number Checker

**Description:**
Write a program that spawns multiple threads, each responsible for checking if a subset of numbers is prime.

**Key Objectives:**
- Use `std::thread` to create threads.
- Show how to start and join threads.
- Pass data to threads via constructor arguments or lambda captures.

**Example Tasks:**
- Input: A range of integers (e.g., 1 to 10,000).
- Split range among threads (e.g., 2 threads each handle half).
- Each thread checks its subset for prime numbers.
- Collect results in the main thread and output them.

## Project 2: “Managing Threads”

### Main Concepts:
- RAII for thread management (e.g., `std::thread` wrapper classes)
- Thread pools (basic introduction)
- Detaching threads vs. joining threads

### Project Idea: Thread Pool for Image Processing

**Description:**
Implement a simple thread pool that processes a queue of image-processing tasks (e.g., applying filters to images).

**Key Objectives:**
- Create a `ThreadPool` class that spins up a fixed number of threads.
- Use RAII techniques to ensure threads are joined/cleaned up.
- Demonstrate the difference between detach and join (though you’ll likely want to join).

**Example Tasks:**
- Each task: Apply a simple filter (like grayscale or edge detection).
- Thread pool ensures tasks are distributed among threads.
- Once tasks are done, verify or display results.

## Project 3: “Sharing Data Between Threads”

### Main Concepts:
- Using `std::mutex`, `std::lock_guard`, `std::unique_lock`
- Potential data races and how to avoid them
- Using `std::shared_mutex` (C++17) or other advanced locking

### Project Idea: Concurrent Key-Value Store

**Description:**
Build a thread-safe key-value store (like a simplified in-memory database) that supports concurrent insert, update, and retrieve operations.

**Key Objectives:**
- Protect shared data (e.g., `std::unordered_map` or `std::map`) with mutexes.
- Demonstrate read-write locks (e.g., `std::shared_mutex` or a read-write mutex).
- Show how data races can occur and how to prevent them.

**Example Tasks:**
- Multiple threads generate random keys and insert or update values.
- Another set of threads continuously queries random keys.
- Measure throughput or add logs to demonstrate concurrency.

## Project 4: “Synchronizing Concurrent Operations”

### Main Concepts:
- Condition variables (`std::condition_variable`)
- Waiting and notifying threads
- Proper use of condition variables to avoid spurious wakeups

### Project Idea: Producer-Consumer with Bounded Buffer

**Description:**
Implement a producer-consumer system using a bounded queue protected by a mutex and synchronized by a condition variable.

**Key Objectives:**
- Multiple producers create data (e.g., random numbers) and push them into a fixed-size buffer.
- Multiple consumers pop data from the buffer for processing.
- Use condition variables to signal availability of space (to producers) and availability of items (to consumers).

**Example Tasks:**
- Show how spurious wakeups are handled correctly.
- Possibly track the number of items processed.
- Graceful shutdown of threads (e.g., sending a special “stop” item).

## Project 5: “The C++ Memory Model and Atomic Operations”

### Main Concepts:
- Memory ordering (relaxed, acquire-release, sequential consistency)
- Atomic operations (`std::atomic`, `std::atomic_flag`)
- Avoiding data races with atomics

### Project Idea: Lock-Free Circular Buffer or Counter

**Description:**
Implement a lock-free data structure (e.g., a single-producer/single-consumer circular buffer or an atomic reference counter).

**Key Objectives:**
- Use `std::atomic` or `std::atomic_flag` for thread-safe access.
- Demonstrate different memory orderings (`memory_order_relaxed`, `memory_order_acquire_release`, `memory_order_seq_cst`) in testing.

**Example Tasks:**
- Single producer writes data into the buffer, single consumer reads data.
- Show performance differences vs. a mutex-based approach.
- Possibly implement a multi-producer or multi-consumer version if you want the extra challenge (but it gets significantly trickier).

## Project 6: “Designing Concurrent Code”

### Main Concepts:
- High-level design patterns in concurrency
- Task decomposition and parallel algorithms
- Avoiding shared state or structuring concurrency to reduce contention

### Project Idea: Parallel Sorting Library

**Description:**
Create a library that implements a parallel version of a sorting algorithm (e.g., merge sort or quicksort).

**Key Objectives:**
- Split the input range into chunks, spawn tasks/threads to sort them, then merge results.
- Use concurrency design patterns to minimize contention and overhead.
- Carefully handle thread creation overhead (e.g., a thread pool or work-stealing approach).

**Example Tasks:**
- Compare performance of your parallel sort against `std::sort`.
- Possibly use an adaptive strategy (e.g., if a sub-range is too small, sort it directly).

## Project 7: “Testing and Debugging Multithreaded Applications”

### Main Concepts:
- Common concurrency pitfalls (race conditions, deadlocks, etc.)
- Techniques for testing (stress testing, sanitizers)
- Debugging tools and best practices

### Project Idea: Multithreaded Bank Simulation with Testing

**Description:**
Simulate a bank system where multiple threads transfer money between accounts. Introduce concurrency bugs on purpose, then test and debug them.

**Key Objectives:**
- Use multiple threads that randomly transfer funds between shared accounts.
- Potential issues: deadlocks (e.g., acquiring multiple locks in different orders), race conditions, etc.
- Write tests that use sanitizers (e.g., ThreadSanitizer) or specialized concurrency testing libraries.

**Example Tasks:**
- Introduce a known bug (like locking accounts in different orders) and see how often it causes a deadlock.
- Demonstrate how to fix it using ordering or a single global mutex.
- Automate tests for repeated runs to trigger concurrency issues.

## Project 8: “Higher-Level Concurrency: Tasks and Futures”

### Main Concepts:
- `std::async`, `std::future`, `std::promise`
- Using packaged tasks (`std::packaged_task`)
- Parallel algorithms in C++17/C++20

### Project Idea: Parallel Web Scraper

**Description:**
Build a simple web scraper that fetches data from multiple URLs in parallel using `std::async` or packaged tasks.

**Key Objectives:**
- Each URL fetch is handled as a task returning a `std::future`.
- Aggregate results in the main thread, handling possible failures (exceptions in futures).
- Demonstrate cancellation or timeout if you wish.

**Example Tasks:**
- Collect webpage titles for a list of URLs.
- Store them in a data structure once each future is ready.
- Use `std::future::get()` to retrieve results and handle errors.

## Project 9: “Advanced Thread Management and the Thread Local Storage”

### Main Concepts:
- Thread-local storage (`thread_local` keyword)
- Advanced threading patterns
- Customizing concurrency for specific platforms

### Project Idea: Thread-Local Cache

**Description:**
Implement a system where each thread maintains a thread-local cache of computations (e.g., expensive function results).

**Key Objectives:**
- Use `thread_local` variables to store partial results.
- Demonstrate benefits of reducing shared data access.
- Merge or synchronize occasionally when necessary.

**Example Tasks:**
- Each thread processes a list of tasks but refers to a thread-local memoization cache.
- Compare performance or lock contention with a purely shared cache design.

## Project 10 (and beyond): “Concurrency Patterns and Frameworks”

### Main Concepts:
- Concurrency frameworks (e.g., Intel TBB, OpenMP, or custom frameworks)
- Patterns like fork/join, pipeline, work-stealing
- Integration with other system-level concurrency features

### Project Idea: Work-Stealing Scheduler / Pipeline Framework

**Description:**
Implement a mini framework that demonstrates a pipeline of tasks with stages, where idle threads can steal work from busy threads.

**Key Objectives:**
- Build a simple scheduler that distributes tasks among worker threads.
- Each stage in the pipeline passes partially processed data to the next stage.
- Idle threads can “steal” tasks from other threads’ queues.

**Example Tasks:**
- A pipeline for data transformation (e.g., parse → transform → analyze → output).
- Stress test the pipeline with many tasks; monitor performance improvements.
- Show how dynamic load balancing helps when certain stages are heavier.

## Putting It All Together

As you work through these projects, you’ll:
- Deepen your understanding of threading and synchronization primitives.
- Experience firsthand the complexities of design, testing, and debugging in concurrent C++.
- Gain practice with both lower-level (mutex, condition_variable) and higher-level (futures, thread pools) approaches.

Feel free to mix and match: for instance, you can incorporate condition variables, atomic operations, and even parallel algorithms into a single project if you want a more integrated experience. The main goal is to isolate the core concept of each project in a small enough project that you can see the impact of concurrency directly.
